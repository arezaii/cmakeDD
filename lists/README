# Lists

CMake lists are really just semicolon `;` separated strings. For this reason it is important not
to use semicolons in your values. If you do, you will need to escape them with a backslash `\`.

## Creating lists

Lists can be created in a few different ways:

```cmake
set(my_list "one;two;three")
set(my_list "one" "two" "three")
set(my_list "one;two" "three")
```

## Accessing list elements
Lists can be accessed using the `list` command:

```cmake
list(GET my_list 0) # one
list(GET my_list 1) # two
list(GET my_list 2) # three
```
