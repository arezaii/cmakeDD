# Generator Expressions

Generator expressions are evaluated at build time and are used to conditionally add compilation options to
a target depending on the compiler being used, build version (debug or release), or other build properties.

## Running the example

From the generator-expressions directory (this directory):

```
cmake -B build-dir .
cmake --build build-dir --target print
```
