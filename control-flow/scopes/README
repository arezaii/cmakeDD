# Scopes

## Function Scope

See function-scope/README

## Directory Scope

Variables declared in a scope can be edited in a subdirectory scope using the PARENT_SCOPE keyword,
however, the variable change will only affect the parent scope. The current scope and any grand-parent
scopes will not be affected.

### Running

```
cmake -B build .
```
