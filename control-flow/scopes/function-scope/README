# Scope and functions

The scope of the variables is local to the function. If you modify a variable inside a function, the change is not visible outside the function.

However, using the PARENT_SCOPE keyword, you can modify a variable that was declared in the parent scope.

### Running

```
cmake -P CMakeLists.txt
```
